# MPAndroidChart Gradient Artifact Demo

This repository is a **minimal Android project** used to **reproduce a gradient fill rendering artifact** in **MPAndroidChart**.

The goal of this project is:
- to demonstrate the gradient artifact under a `LineChart`
- to provide a simple setup for investigating the issue
- to show how the problem can be fixed or mitigated

This project intentionally uses a very simple dataset to keep the focus on the rendering problem.
